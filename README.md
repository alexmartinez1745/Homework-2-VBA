### Files

* [Test Data](Resources/alphabetical_testing.xlsx) - Was used for running and testing scripts.

* [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Ran scripts on this data for final report.


## Instructions

* Created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following:

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.
